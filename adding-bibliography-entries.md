# How to add bibliography entries

We have another custom file format for the bibliography, which is contained in
`bibliography.txt`. The format is as follows:

```
<category>
<site>
<citations>
```

The citations for the current site are listed on several lines, with one URL on
each line. After listing all the citations for the current site, insert a blank
line. Then, after listing all sites in the category, insert two blank lines. I
put all the sites I saw on the spreadsheet into the bibliography already, but
if the sites have changed, you want to reorder things, or you need to make any
other changes, now you know the format!
