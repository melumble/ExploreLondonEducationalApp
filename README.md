This interactive map of London allows users to explore historical sites around the city. Users are able to click on a pin to learn more about a location. The pins are associated with
learning themes such as Art and Culture, Bridges, Crime, Government, Religion and the Royal Family. Users can take quizzes associated with themes to earn badges. Badges use the Box2D 
physics engine to bounce around the map. Once all the quizzes have been passed the user is presented with a celebration screen.
