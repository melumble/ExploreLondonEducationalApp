Tower Bridge
Bridges
<p>
    Amid increasing activity and commercial development in East London, the
    Special Bridge or Subway Committee was formed in 1876 and tasked with
    designing and building a bridge east of London Bridge that crossed the
    River Thames. In the Victorian era, the port of London was the busiest port
    in the world. Thus, the new bridge would have to be built in such a way as
    to allow river traffic to get past the bridge.
</p>
<p>
    After a public competition brought in more than 50 designs, a drawbridge
    design that mimicked the architecture of the iconic Tower of London was
    selected. Construction of the design took eight years.
</p>
<p>
    Even today, with the port of London relocated further east, river traffic
    still takes priority over road traffic on the Tower Bridge. Thus, any boat
    tall enough to warrant it can request a free bridge lift with 24 hours'
    notice.

Millennium Bridge
Bridges
<p>
    The Millennium Bridge was opened to the public on June 10, 2000, the first
    new pedestrian bridge to be built in London in over a century. Connecting
    St. Paul's Cathedral and the Tate Modern art gallery, its minimalist,
    futuristic design expressed hope and exuberance as the world entered a new
    millennium.
</p>
<p>
    However, within hours of the public opening, a big problem had emerged: the
    bridge was swaying from side to side, earning itself a nickname of the
    'Wobbly Bridge.' This had occurred because its natural frequency was close
    to that of human walking. Thus, it only took a few people to get the bridge
    moving, which started a self-reinforcing cycle in which people would adjust
    their walking to the movement, unintentionally synchronizing their steps
    with thousands of other people and intensifying the swaying.
</p>
<p>
    Fortunately, while the swaying was scary, the bridge was never at risk of
    collapse. However, the whole ordeal was a big embarrassment. It took $8.9
    million and two years to install 91 dampers to absorb lateral and vertical
    oscillations.
</p>
<p>
    Today, the Millennium Bridge is highly trafficked, completely safe, and
    movement-free. It is an iconic landmark and major tourist destination in
    21st century London.

House of Hanover
Royal Family
<p>
    Queen Charlotte, born Princess Sophie Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, was
    the wife of King George III of England. Their marriage in 1761 marked the
    beginning of a partnership that endured through some of the most tumultuous
    periods in British history. King George III, though plagued by mental illness
    in his later years, was a conscientious monarch who oversaw the expansion of
    the British Empire. However, he is blamed throughout history for the loss of
    the American colonies. Together, Queen Charlotte and King George III were
    the parents of fifteen children, establishing the House of Hanover's dynasty
    in England. Though they had many children, they were only grandparents to
    one legitimate grandchild: Queen Victoria.
</p>
<p>
    Queen Victoria, who reigned over the United Kingdom from 1837 to 1901, earned
    the nickname "Grandmother of Europe" due to her extensive familial connections
    across the continent through marriage. Victoria and her husband, Prince Albert
    of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, had nine children, who married into various European
    royal families. Their descendants occupied the thrones of several European
    nations. Her children married into royal houses such as Prussia, Russia,
    Greece, Romania, Spain, and Norway, creating intricate webs of allyship among
    Europe's ruling monarchies. This interconnectedness among European royals had
    both positive and negative effects, fostering peace and cooperation but also
    contributing to the tensions that eventually erupted into the First World War.
</p>
<p>
    FUN FACT:
    The first ever royal family photograph was taken in 1842 when Queen Victoria
    and Prince Albert posed for a portrait with their children. The photo, which
    was a daguerreotype, was an instant sensation and paved the way for many more
    royal portraits to come.

House of Tudor
Royal Family
<p>
    Henry VIII, the infamous Tudor monarch of England, is perhaps best known for
    his six marriages, which had significant political and personal ramifications.
    His first wife, Catherine of Aragon, was his brother's widow, and their union
    ended in divorce, sparking England's break from the Catholic Church. Henry's
    second wife, Anne Boleyn, bore him a daughter, Queen Elizabeth I, but fell
    out of favor and was executed on charges of adultery and treason. Jane
    Seymour, his third wife, gave birth to his long-awaited male heir, Edward VI,
    but died shortly after. Anne of Cleves, his fourth wife, was divorced after
    a short and unconsummated marriage, leading to Henry's marriage to Catherine
    Howard, whose alleged infidelity resulted in her execution. Finally, Henry
    married Catherine Parr, who outlived him and played a significant role in the
    upbringing of his children. These marriages not only shaped Henry's reign but
    also had profound effects on the religious and political landscape of England
    during the turbulent Tudor period.
</p>
<p>
    Queen Elizabeth I was the last monarch of the Tudor dynasty and reigned over
    England from 1558 until her death in 1603. Often referred to as the "Virgin
    Queen," Elizabeth's reign is known as the Elizabethan era, a period of
    significant cultural, economic, and military expansion for England. Her reign
    saw the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588, solidifying England's naval
    dominance and marking a pivotal moment in European history. She became Queen
    after the death of her elder sister Queen Mary, the daughter of Henry VIII
    and Catherine of Aragon. Mary and Elizabeth were the only legitimate children
    of Henry VIII. Despite facing challenges such as religious tensions and
    threats to her throne, Elizabeth's shrewd leadership and unwavering
    determination secured her place as one of England's most iconic and
    influential monarchs.

House of Saxe-Coburg & Gotha/Windsor
Royal Family
<p>
    Through her marriage to Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Queen Victoria and
    Prince Albert founded the House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, succeeding the House of Hanover.
    Victoria and Albert's marriage was not only a love match (rare) but also a strategic0
    union to strengthen ties between Britain and continental Europe. In 1857, under the
    Royal Proclamation issued by Queen Victoria, the royal family's house name was officially
    changed to the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, reflecting Albert's lineage.
</p>
<p>
    The house name change from Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to Windsor occurred during World War I,
    reflecting the need to distance the British monarchy from its German connections due to
    anti-German sentiment in the United Kingdom. King George V, who ascended the throne in 1910,
    was a direct descendant of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, and therefore, belonged to
    the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. However, amid rising tensions with Germany during the war,
    particularly following air raids on Britain by German Zeppelins, the British royal family felt
    compelled to demonstrate their allegiance to the nation. In 1917, King George V issued a royal
    proclamation declaring that all male-line descendants of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert who
    were British subjects would bear the surname Windsor, after Windsor Castle, one of the royal
    residences. This change aimed to emphasize the British identity of the royal family and alleviate
    public concerns about their German heritage. The adoption of the Windsor name marked a significant
    shift in the monarchy's public image and helped to reinforce its connection with the British people
    during a period of national crisis.
</p>
<p>
    Currently, King Charles III is the head of the British monarchy. He is directly related to Queen
    Victoria through his maternal lineage. Queen Victoria, who reigned from 1837 to 1901, was Prince
    Charles's great-great-grandmother. King Charles' lineage can be traced back to Queen Victoria through
    several generations, highlighting the intricate connections within the British royal family's family tree.

London Bridge
Bridges
<p>
    Since London's founding as the Roman city of Londinium in 50 CE, Londoners
    have needed to cross the River Thames. As early as 52 CE, the Romans built
    a wooden bridge spanning the Thames. Over the centuries, as empires rose
    and fell, various bridges and ferries facilitated river crossings.
</p>
<p>
    However, the famous London Bridge—the one referenced in the children's
    game—was started in 1176 by Peter of Colechurch. It replaced a wooden
    bridge, emerging as Britain's first significant stone arch bridge.
    Supported by 19 massive piers, the bridge significantly restricted the
    river's flow, offering thrill-seeking boaters the opportunity to "shoot the
    bridge."
</p>
<p>
    Adding to its medieval charm, over 100 houses and shops lined both sides of
    the bridge's (sometimes quite narrow) carriageway, transforming it into a
    bustling hub of commerce and travel. Despite enduring numerous challenges,
    including the collapse of five arches in 1282 and two Great Fires—in 1666
    and 1725—London Bridge survived as the only Thames crossing until the
    opening of Westminster Bridge in 1750.
</p>
<p>
    After the opening, the city decided to repair London Bridge. However, the
    constant erosion of the river bed—which intensified after repairs were made
    to the bridge—had increased the maintenance burden, and it was ultimately
    decided to build a new bridge a few meters upstream. The second London
    Bridge was completed in 1831, retiring its predecessor after 622 years of
    service.
</p>
<p>
    Yet, the second bridge's tenure was relatively short-lived. In the early
    1960s, it was discovered that modern car traffic was causing the
    bridge—which had survived the Blitzkrieg in WWII—to sink into the Thames.
    Thus, in 1968, crews started dismantling the bridge after 137 years of
    service. It was shipped and reassembled in Lake Havasu City, Arizona, where
    it can still be seen today. In 1972, the current London Bridge, a modest
    concrete structure, took its place, inheriting the rich history of
    millennia of London crossings over the River Thames.

Downing Street
Government
<p>
Downing Street contains the official office and residence of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.
It not only contains living spaces and office areas, but also state drawing rooms and dining rooms for
visiting officials, and a cabinet room. The location is known for its iconic black front door and bricks.
</p>
<p>
Sir George Downing created the row of houses on Downing Street in 1682 as a location for the government
because of the nearby Whitehall Palace. King George II then gave 5 Downing Street to the first lord
of the Treasury, Robert Walpole. Walpole accepted if the future first lords of the Treasury would
also be housed there, with the title changing to prime minister in 1905. The number was renamed to
10 in 1779.
</p>
<p>
Due to the importance of the building, it was a target of a Blitz attack during World War
II and an Irish Republican Army bombing in 1991.

Parliament and Big Ben
Government
<p>
The history of Parliament can be traced back to the 13th century. The different English
counties would send knights to the king to establish tax laws. In the later part of the
13th century, King Edward I would have meetings combining the Magnum Concilium (high ranking
ecclesiastical figures) and the Curia Regis (the King’s advisors) to solve judicial issues
above day to day law. Knights and Burgesses would also accompany the Magnum Concilium.
</p>
<p>
The “Model Parliament” in 1295 is known as the first representative parliament. This is because
they had lower clergy members and two knights from each county, two burgesses from each borough,
and two citizens from each city. Then in the 14th century there was a shift from parliament solving
judicial issues to legislative ones once the Privy Council took over judicial matters. This also
brought about legislative issues being introduced in bills and not just from royalty.
</p>
<p>
Big Ben is located on the northern end of the Houses of Parliament. Big Ben is actually not the
name of the tower, but only the hour bell. The original name was St. Stephen’s Tower, but in 2012
it became Elizabeth Tower for Elizabeth II’s Diamond Jubilee. Big Ben only needs to be wound three
times a week, and each time it is wound it takes over an hour. The clock and the tower were installed
at the same time in 1859, and the name Big Ben is said to come from Sir Benjamin Hall, who
commissioned the tower.

<p>
The Churchill War Rooms is a museum which contains the Cabinet War Rooms. It acted as a wartime
bunker during the Blitz for Churchill and his staff, but also contained a “Map Room” which was
a military information center which collected military information for the use of the officials.
The Cabinet War Rooms had not become operational and were under construction until August of 1939.
That was only a week before Britain declared war on Germany.

Westminster Abbey
Religion
<p>
    Westminster Abbey has a rich history that is most often associated with the Royal Family and its long Anglican tradition.
    The church has been the site for every royal coronation since 1066 and has been host to 16 royal weddings.
</p>
<p>
    Along with its royal ties, the abbey’s iconic gothic architecture, famous burial sites and spotlight in the media
    had made it an attraction for worshipers and tourists alike. While the grounds of the abbey have be designated as a
    religious site since the 1040s, the building seen today was built during King Henry III's reign during the mid 1200s.
    The flying buttresses, vaulted nave and stained-glass chapels exhibit the staples of gothic architecture.
</p>
<p>
    The church is also the resting place of many famous Britains including Isaac Newton and Mary Queen of Scots. With
    an expansive history the church attracts many visitors, even more with its prevalence in the media– most recently as
    the location for the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II in September of 2022 and the coronation of King Charles in May of 2023.

St Paul's Cathedral
Religion
<p>
    St Paul’s Cathedral is a prominent feature in the London skyline and is most known for its iconic dome. This
    cathedral, which held the title of tallest building in London til 1963, did not always have its ornate English
    Baroque Style appearance. The original medieval church, now known as “Old St Pauls”, dates back to 604 when the
    building was consecrated. This first church survived through the reformation, becoming an Anglican church during
    the reign of Henry VIII, until it eventually burned down in the 1666 Great Fire of London.
</p>
<p>
    Christopher Wren was appointed to design the new church in 1668 and faced resistance as some considered his design
    to be too untraditional. The church we see today was completed in 1711 and continues to hold services, memorials
    and celebrations. Some of the most notable events held at St Paul’s include Queen Victoria’s Diamond Jubilee in
    1897 and the marriage of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer in 1980.

Tower of London
Religion
<p>
    The Tower of London is historically known as a palace, prison and fortress. Its extensive history with housing
    royalty and royal guards led to the construction of a chapel on the grounds for the fortresses occupants. The
    Chapel Royal of St Peter and Vincula as it appears now was built during the reign of Henry VIII, but the location
    of the chapel has been a site of worship since the first structure of the fortress was built by William the
    Conqueror in the 1070s.
</p>
<p>
    This chapel, while not very impressive in appearance, is a popular stop for visitors of the Tower of London
    given it is the burial site of three Queens of England: Anne Boleyn, Catherine Howard and Jane Grey. The famous
    wives of Henry VIII and their executions, marked by their remains being unceremoniously buried in the chapel,
    contribute to the dark history of the fortress. The eerie stories of the queens’ beheadings at the King’s orders
    continues to draw visitors to the chapel where marble paver stones were installed in 1876 to memorialize the
    queens.

Jack The Ripper
Crimes
<p>
Jack The Ripper is an infamous murderer in London. It was a pseudonym given to the killer that killed many women in the Whitechapel area of London from 1888 to 1892. There are dozens of murders that could possibly be connected, but only five were confirmed to be done by the same person. They were Mary Ann Nichols (whose body was found on August 31), Annie Chapman (found September 8), Elizabeth Stride (found September 30), Catherine (Kate) Eddowes (found September 30), and Mary Jane Kelly (found November 9).
</p>
<p>
They all had been murdering in a similar why now called a serial killer’s signature. EH would cut the victim’s throat and mutilate the body. However, the mutilation was done in a way that the police suspected that the murderer had knowledge of anatomy, so may have been trained at least partially as a doctor. The police also received notes taunting them by a person claiming to be Jack the Ripper. They were not able to ever capture the murderer even with public outrage and curiosity.
</p>
<p>
There were many suspects at the time and even now there are many theories and conspiracies; however, we will never know the true killer. One of the more popular theories is Charles Lechmere. He was in the area and streets at the times of all the murders. He also discovered the first victim and called a gut named Paul over. He did not want Paul to sit up the body possible because he did not want him to find the throat cut. Also, Paul recalled there not being blood when he got there, btu a pool of blood a short while later showing the body had been killed recently and no one was seen fleeing the area which had no side exits. The theory is that Lechmere heard Paul while killing the victim and to not be suspicious covered the body and then called him over to be a witness not a suspect.

The Gunpowder Plot of 1605
Crimes
<p>
The Gunpowder Plot was a conspiracy to blow up the Houses of Parliament. It is historically believed to be run by the Jesuits in order to order to kill the king and government to facilitate a change of power as they had been persecuted for decades in England. There is also more recent thoughts that it was a protestant plot to help continue the protestant takeover and turn public opinion against the Jesuits.
</p>
<p>
The conspirators planned to blow up the House of the Lords on November 5, 1605. They had the explosives already in place in an undercroft under the building that they had purchased. However, an anonymous letter was delivered to Lord Monteagle that told him not to attend parliament. Concerned, he shared it and the letter made its way up the chain of command and a search was done of Parliament. It was around midnight when the police thoroughly searched the undercroft and found the gunpowder and Guy Fawkes. There are no leads on the letters source and whether it was real or a forgery. Some thought it to be one of the plotters feeling remorse and giving up the plot to stop the killing.
</p>
<p>
After, they got Guy Fawkes the eventually tracked down many of the other conspirators and tortured them in the Tower of London. All the conspirators not killed in the capturing were tried and sentenced to death by hanging, drawing, and quartering. Their bodies were also hung around London as an example to others to not mess with the government. Today, on November 5 in Britain, they celebrate their survival from the plot by setting of fireworks in a holiday called “Guy Fawkes Day” or "Fireworks Night".

Theft of the Crown Jewels
Crimes
<p>
The Theft of the Crown Jewels was an attempt by Colonel Blood to steal the Crown Jewels. Thomas Blood, an Irishman, was a justice of the peace for Cromwell and lost his lands when Charles the Second came to power. So, down on his luck he decided to steal the crown jewels. He and his wife became friends with Talbot Edwards and his family because he was the Keeper of the Jewels. He lived by the basement of the Tower of London where the Jewels where kept.
<\p>
<p>
Blood then came one time with his rich “nephew” to meet Edwards’ daughter for a potential marriage. While they daughter and “nephew” were getting to know each other, he told Edwards that they wanted to see the Crown Jewels. As soon as Edwards unlocked the door in the basement, Blood knocked him out and stabbed him. He then smashed the crown and out it in a bag and put the orb down his pants. However, the scepter was too hard to hide so they tried sawing it. However, Edwards woke up and shouted for help.
</p>
<p>
Blood and his accomplishes tried to escape, but they got caught trying to sneak out of one of the gates out of the Tower of London. He was then brought before Kong Charles and his consul. Luckily for Blood, the king liked audacious criminals, and after Blood told his story the king was amused and pardoned Blood and gave him land in Ireland. Blood got away scotch free and was able to live until 62, while Edwards stayed at the tower and told visitors the story of the theft.

Globe Theatre
Arts and Culture
<p>
The Globe Theatre was constructed in 1599 by Shakespeare and his company with the Lord Chamberlain's Men as they could not use the roofed Blackfriars Theatre made by their lead actor's father as the inheritance was tied up among his sons. Further, influential citizens of Blackfriars convinced the government to ban its use for plays. They dismantled and used the timber of the father's other theatre just called The Theatre as the lease had expired (which was illegal).
</p>
<p>
This new open-air theatre found great success, and in 1608 the company finally got access to the Blackfriars Theatre they had wanted. Instead of renting out one of the theatres to a different company, they decided to manage both theatres, using the open Globe in summer and the Blackfriars in winter.
</p>
<p>
In 1613 during a performance of Henry VIII, the Globe was burned down. Rather than transferring full-time to the Blackfriars (which was making more money), they decided to rebuild the Globe better than before.

The London Eye is a Ferris wheel on the south bank of the Thames in the borough of Lambeth. It is 443' tall. It was made in 1999 and was the tallest Ferris wheel in the world until 2006. It was submitted in a competition for a new landmark to celebrate the new millenium. Despite the competition not having a winner, the submitters, David Marks and Julia Barfield decided to build it anyway.
</p>
<p>
It was built over the river Thames and flipped into the position it is in now. Much of the funding for construction was provided by British Airways, and it started construction in 1998. It was opened to the public by Prime Minister Tony Blair December 31 1999 but didn't actually start taking passengers until March 9 2000. The Eye has 32 chambers that can each hold 25 people. It rotates twice per hour. The Eye changed hands from its original owners in 2006 and is now under Blackstone Group's Merlin Entertainments Group subsidiary.
